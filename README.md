Code file for ECON 21160 Problem Set 7 at the University of Chicago

## Instructions
There are many files in this folder. Do not be overwhelmed. Only a few are relevant. Sorting the files by type will make your life easier.
- `ECON 21160 Problem Set 7.pdf` is my written response to this assignment. That is THE most important file.
- `homework-victor.do` is the Do file. This is the second most important file.
- `homework-victor.log` and `homework-victor.smcl` are the log files that Dr. Harrison requested. 
- `homework-victor.pdf` is the PDF exported version of the log file.

The `.tex` and `.png` files are used in compiling the written responses. Do not delete them. The `.dta` files are, obviously, used in building regressions.

The rest of the files are irrelevant.
