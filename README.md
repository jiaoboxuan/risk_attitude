# `individual_risk_attitude`
Code file for ECON 21160 Problem Set 7 at the University of Chicago, for Professor Glenn Harrison.

## Instructions
There are many folders and files in this folder. Do not be overwhelmed. Only a few are relevant. Sorting the files by type will make your life easier.
- `ECON 21160 Problem Set 7.pdf` is in `homework_files/homework_responses`. It is my written response to this assignment.
- `homework-victor.do` is in `code` folder. It is the Do file. This is the second most important file.
- `homework-victor.log` and `homework-victor.smcl` are in `outputs/log`. They are log files that were requested as part of the assignment submission.
- `homework-victor.pdf`, also in `outputs/log`, is the PDF exported version of the log file.

The `.tex` and `.png` files are used in compiling the written responses. Do not delete them. The `.dta` files are, obviously, used in building regressions.
